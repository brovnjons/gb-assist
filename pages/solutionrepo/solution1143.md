#### Description

In the M&O industry, geometric alignment and measurement are needed in many applications such as shaft alignment, line bore applications, flatness/ straightness measurement and machine tool alignment. Traditional alignment methods include visual inspection combined with a straightedge or use of dial indicators, which are inaccurate and time consuming.

Laser geometric alignment systems are quick and easy to deploy, and accurate results can be consistently obtained with minimal rework.
